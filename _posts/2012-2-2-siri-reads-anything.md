    title: Getting Siri To Read You Anything
    snippet: Well, almost anything.
---

I was walking home from class last night, and it was quite chilly outside. (That's right, 50Â°F is cold for Californians. Everyone else, we understand that life is unfair. Sorry about that.) I had to read a fairly long article for one of my classes, and since I wasn't doing anything else, I thought I could read on my iPhone. But my hands were freezing (okay, I'm exaggerating a bit), and the screen is tiny for long reading. At that moment, out of sheer necessity, I discovered something amazing.

If you have an iPhone, do it with me:

1. Open [this long article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/americanexceptionalism.htm) in Safari.
2. Touch and hold the text, select everything after the title, and copy it.
3. Compose a new iMessage to your own iPhone's number. Wait until the send button is blue (to make sure it's really an iMessage).
4. Paste the text, hit send and then IMMEDIATELY press the home button. If all goes well, you'll get a push notification about a new iMessage. DON'T OPEN IT.
5. Ready for some sorcery? Press and hold the home button until you hear Siri's familiar ding-ding, and say "Read me my messages."

In her oh-so-sexy voice, Siri begins, "Chapter 1."

_Edit_: Thanks to ben in the comments, there's a better way to have Siri read anything to you. If you go to Settings > General > Accessibility > Speak Selection and change it to ON, you can highlight any text and a Speak option will appear next to Copy. Siri will read the highlighted text and you can even pause it. Thanks ben! (But since your tip totally invalidates the entire post above, my ghost will haunt you forever.)
