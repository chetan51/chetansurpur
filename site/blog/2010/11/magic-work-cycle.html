	<!-- Hyde::Article::Begin -->

<p>A year ago, I switched to the <a href="http://colemak.com/">Colemak keyboard layout</a>. I&#8217;ve since had zero pain in my hands when typing for many hours straight, I&#8217;ve been able to type faster, and I make fewer mistakes while&nbsp;typing.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I decided to try the <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/forums/health-fitness/1638-switching-biphasic-sleeping-start-here.html">biphasic sleep cycle</a>. It worked as advertised, allowing me to get better sleep and need less of it. I used to sleep for 9 - 10 hours each day, and now I need just 6 - 7.5 to stay just as sprightly, if not&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, after these successful life hacks, my friend told me about the eccentric work cycle that he&nbsp;follows.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>You might think it&#8217;s crazy and stupid, but it works for me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I sit at my desk and <strong>work for 30 minutes without distraction</strong>, completely absorbed in my work. Then, after the 30 minutes are up, I drop whatever I&#8217;m doing and go <strong>do something fun for 30 minutes</strong>. During this relaxation time, I don&#8217;t think about work at all - I play games, write, whatever, but no work. After 30 minutes, I go back to my desk, rinse and&nbsp;repeat.&#8221; </p>
<p>Immediately, I&nbsp;thought,</p>
<p><span class="quo">&#8216;</span>That won&#8217;t work for me.&#8217;<br />
&#8216;Switching context that often would be too distracting.&#8217;<br />
&#8216;When I&#8217;m in my groove, I can&#8217;t drop it and come back to it easily.&#8217;<br />
&#8216;It sounds like it would take twice as long to get anything done!&#8217;<br />
</p>
<p><span class="quo">&#8216;</span>Hmmm. Screw it. I&#8217;ll give it a&nbsp;shot.&#8217;</p>
<p>You can probably tell by now where this story is&nbsp;going.</p>
<h3>Abracadabra</h3>
<p>It&nbsp;works.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>While working on a software project, I would get stuck on a bug and spend hours trying to figure out what went wrong, addicted to the quest and unable to stop, even when I run out of ideas on what else to&nbsp;try.</p>
<p>Now, I stop at the 30 minute mark and relax for half an hour, and when I come back to my computer, my calm mind has a divine inspiration in the first 5 minutes and I blow the bug to smithereens, saving countless hours of&nbsp;exasperation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would dread each essay assigned in my humanities class. I would have to spend 2 hours planning my essay, 3 hours staring at Microsoft Word and then another 4 hours painstakingly writing the essay for school (a total of 9+ precious hours down the drain). Most of these hours would be spent in frustration, hating life and the college humanities requirement, and refreshing Gmail and iGoogle every 5 minutes, putting off the time I would have to buckle down and&nbsp;write.</p>
<p>The other day, I spent a total of 3.5 hours (1 hour planning and 30 minutes on each paragraph) and finished my latest essay, no sweat.<br />
</p>
<p>Oh, and while writing the essay, I also ended up finishing the Halo Reach&nbsp;campaign.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I used to cordon off entire days to study for my midterms, and spend most of them procrastinating and wasting&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Now, I know that given 8 hours, I&#8217;ll have complete focus for 4 of them, and that&#8217;s all the total concentrated studying I need for the midterm. Planning is easier, and so is the studying&nbsp;process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And the best part is, I don&#8217;t stress about work as much. I know exactly how much I can get done given a set amount of time. Time is now my bitch, not the other way&nbsp;around.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Revealing the&nbsp;trick</h3>
<p>So why does it&nbsp;work?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The work you do is more&nbsp;focused.</strong></p>
<p>Instead of constantly checking your email or <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed while you work, distracting yourself and having to switch context every few minutes, you get 30 minutes of solid, focused work. And it&#8217;s not too hard to stay focused since the promise of a 30 minute break is just around the&nbsp;corner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>There is less time to work in each interval, so there is more incentive to focus and work hard in the little time you&nbsp;have.</strong></p>
<p>Normally, I find it hard to focus if I feel like I have a whole day to get something done, or something isn&#8217;t due for a while. The 30 minute restriction makes it feel like you only have half an hour to get something done, so it provides a psychological incentive to work harder and finish &#8220;in&nbsp;time&#8221;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s less stressful, since relaxation occurs&nbsp;regularly.</strong></p>
<p>Spending a ton of hours <em>trying</em> to work still feels like a ton of hours of work, even if you end up getting nothing done. With the 30/30 cycle, you&#8217;re only working half the time, and the relaxation time actually feels like relaxation without the stress of work. This makes many continuous hours of work much more bearable and&nbsp;productive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When stuck on a problem, taking the 30 minute break works&nbsp;wonders.</strong></p>
<p>Anyone who has fixed a difficult bug (or even been stuck on a difficult level of a video game) can attest to this. Clearing your mind allows inspiration to sneak its way in when you come back to your desk. Taking a break regularly is a useful habit to adopt even outside of the 30/30&nbsp;cycle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s&nbsp;fun!</strong></p>
<p>Work doesn&#8217;t even feel like work anymore. It feels more like a game, with checkpoints every 30 minutes and a regular prize to look forward&nbsp;to.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The proverbial&nbsp;catch</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve only been doing this for a few weeks, so I have yet to see if it&#8217;s a sustainable model. But it&#8217;s been working great so far, so I&#8217;m very&nbsp;optimistic.</p>
<p>It also takes a certain level of discipline when I&#8217;m in the 30 minute work interval, which I&#8217;m able to achieve now, because of the novelty of a new approach. But it shouldn&#8217;t be too hard to maintain, since the intervals are so short and there is always a reward to look forward&nbsp;to.</p>
<h3>Go forth and prosper, my&nbsp;children</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in trying the 30/30 work cycle, please let me know in the comments, and make sure you update your comments later with how it goes! I&#8217;d love to hear about&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you think 30 minutes might be too short, feel free to experiment. One size most definitely does not fit all, and you might benefit more from a 60/30 min cycle, or whatever. After all, if I don&#8217;t have enough time, or if I&#8217;m working on something inherently fun, I end up using a 60/30 cycle. Basically, the point is to set aside regular intervals of relaxation and fun to keep your mind fresh and alert throughout. How you go about doing it is totally up to&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>Okay, my thirty minutes are up. I&#8217;m off to start the Black Ops campaign. Good luck and&nbsp;godspeed.</p>
