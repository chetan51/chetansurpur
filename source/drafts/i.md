title: "I"
---

I am not happy, or sad, or excited. I am not seeing a candle, or hearing the rain, or tasting sweetness on my tongue. I am not remembering childhood, or imagining a kiss, or daydreaming about future success.

I simply am.

I observe happiness arising within. I observe sadness and excitability. I observe the light of a candle, the sound of the rain, the sweet taste in my mouth. I observe reminiscent memories of my childhood days, observe the pleasant idea of a kiss on my lips, observe the warm images of hopeful success.

But I am not these things. How could I be, if I can see them plainly in front of me like a movie on a theater screen?

Then what am I?

I simply am.
