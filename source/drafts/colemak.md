title: "Ditch QWERTY – Your Hands Need Colemak"
---

If I offered you the choice of typing at a third of your current typing speed for _one month_ in exchange for typing even faster and more comfortably than you do now _for the rest of your life_, would you take it?

Let me ask you another question. Look down at your keyboard. Have you ever wondered why the keys are arranged in that way?

The answer might surprise you. The key arrangement on almost every single keyboard in existence, including yours, was specifically designed to slow you down while you type.

The QWERTY keyboard layout that you're probably using right now was actually made for typewriters. Turns out, when you type too fast on one of the original typewriters, the rods under the keys would sometimes collide and break. So a clever man named Mr. Sholes had the brilliant idea of arranging the keys in such a way that typists would _have_ to type more slowly, and that decision has been screwing everyone over even through the digital age.

## Enter Colemak

That's where [Colemak](http://colemak.com/) comes in. It's an alternate keyboard layout made for the modern age, engineered to provide maximally efficient typing. Here's what it looks like:

The keys in Colemak are scientifically arranged with the following goals in mind:

* Fingers should travel the least distance possible
* Most of the typing should be done on the strongest and fastest fingers
* Typing should alternate between the hands for greater speed and comfort
* Should be easy to learn and switch from QWERTY

And it succeeds in meeting those goals:

* Your fingers on QWERTY move 2.2x more than on Colemak. QWERTY has 16x more same hand row jumping than Colemak. There are 35x more words you can type using only the home row on Colemak.
* Allows easy transition from QWERTY. Only 2 keys move between hands. Many common shortcuts (including Ctrl+Z/X/C/V) remain the same.
* Most of the typing is done on the strongest and fastest fingers. Low same-finger ratio.
* Built-in to Mac OS X and most Linux distributions, and available as free software on Windows.

All this means you can frictionlessly switch to Colemak and type faster you ever could with QWERTY, and ward off [RSI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury) and [Carpal Tunnel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome) as you do. It's really a no-brainer.
