I've noticed that I have very definite likes and dislikes, hard boundaries around my particular tastes.

For example, there is a certain kind of music that I love (electronic/indie/chillout), and a certain kind of music that I hate (hard rap, death metal). There are other kinds of music I moderately like or somewhat dislike or am ambivalent towards. But the boundaries are fairly sharp and clear. When someone plays something I don't like, I mentally cringe and suffer through it.

I want to change this about myself. I want to be more open to all experiences, no matter how tasteful they are to me. I want to let go of this judgmental state of mind that colors every experience with its expectations.

It can definitely be changed. With practice and an open mind, you can develop new taste for even the most unpleasant things. The only thing keeping me from enjoying something is my own preconception of it.

If I could become consciously aware of the rejecting sensation in my mind as I experience something I don't like, I could see through it to the experience itself. It is possible to simply gaze upon a naked experience without judgment or attachment. This ability is called mindfulness.

The first and most difficult step is becoming aware of even having the feeling of revulsion. Oftentimes our minds automatically reject something so quickly that we don't even realize we are doing it. By that point it's a foregone conclusion that it will be a painful experience. But if we can catch ourselves in the act, we can learn to overcome this habit. All it takes is awareness.

So from now on, I resolve to at least notice when I don't like something, and observe the thoughts and feelings that arise in my mind as I experience it. I will then gradually be able to experience it in the present moment, cleaned of my preconceptions and expectations. Then I will be free to enjoy it as it really is.
