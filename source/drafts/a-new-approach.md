title: "A New Approach"
---

I [committed](http://chetansurpur.com/blog/2014/01/quantity-and-quality.html) to publishing a blog post every two weeks, regardless of its level of quality. I have failed that commitment in the last month.

I drafted my last two posts in time, but they got stuck in the review / editing phase. Though I was supposed to publish them without worrying about quality, they were too important to me to publish subpar. So I decided to hold off publishing until they were ready. And thus I dropped the ball entirely, failing even to edit and publish them quickly.

I could just pick it up and try again (and in any other circumstance, that would be the right move), but I'm going to try a different approach instead.

When I started this exercise, I wanted to become a better writer. For that, I knew that consistency is key, and quality comes with time. Now, I realized that I don't just want to become a better writer. I want to become a better thinker, and I hope to use writing as a tool to do just that.

The best way to fully learn something is to explain it to someone else. There's a lot to learn, and the greatest pleasure is to understand something deeply. I'm going to use writing as my way to explain the things I'm learning, in order to completely understand it myself. I will be doing this for my own sake, but the more accessible I make it to the average reader, the better. After all, you don't really understand something until you can explain it to a child.

For this, I'll have to spend time on quality, so I won't make any commitment on publishing throughput. However, I believe this will automatically draw me in to writing more, since I will be using it to support something that I already enjoy naturally. It will also give me a clear goal to work towards for every post, requiring less sheer willpower to sit down and write. I'm excited about this new approach, and I'm eager to get started. Time will tell how effective it is.
