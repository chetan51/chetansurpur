title: "Intuitive AI: A Primer"
---

_"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." - Arthur C. Clarke_

Artificial Intelligence is a field devoted to creating something truly magical. The autonomous agents we can build with a little bit of math and computer science learn from past experiences, plan for future ones, and achieve goals without being ever explicitly preprogrammed on what decisions to make.

This series will introduce you to the science and art of AI, infuse you with a deep understanding of how intelligent, complex behavior can emerge from following some simple rules and watching relevant data, and get you building these agents from scratch yourself. 

This primer is for anyone who would be fascinated by AI, and no matter how much background you have, my goal is to make sure you're with me every step of the way. If you have no programming experience, that's okay; feel free to skip any technical details, and if I promise you'll still end up with a complete high-level understanding of what our little inorganic organisms are doing and how they work. On the other hand, if you can code, I'll make sure you also grasp the nitty-gritty intuitively enough to build AI agents on your own. Sounds good?

First, a disclaimer: I'm by no means an expert on the subject.  I'm writing this because:

* I love AI, and I want you to too
* I want to cement my understanding of the material and learn it as deeply as possible; what better way than to teach it?
* I believe that if I speak directly to the learner (you!) and put myself in your shoes (as I was not too long ago), "complex" subjects like AI can become very interesting and truly easy to absorb, and this is my attempt at making that happen

So if you see anything that's blatantly incorrect, please call me out on it in the comments and I'll make corrections. But I'm hoping that with the goal of writing everything as transparently and intuitively as possible, there won't be any hand-wavy bullshit that can give rise to wrong teaching.

I'll write this in a blog-series style, so I'll just start with a simple, short-term plan, release early and often, and make corrections on the fly. Piece-by-piece, I'll try to build a resource with which anyone can get a clear picture on how artificially intelligent agents work.

Now hold on to your hats; we're about to make ourselves some _goddamn intelligence_.
