title: "Biphasic Sleep Experiment"
---

Most of us sleep once daily, for 6-9 hours every night. For someone who has too much to do and not enough time, these are a great many precious hours wasted. But there is a potential solution. Instead of sleeping once daily, [polyphasic sleep patterns](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Polyphasic_sleep) promise equal to more effective sleep in less time. These claims aren't necessarily substantiated, but I want to try for myself.

There are a few options for different sleep cycles. I've settled on the biphasic sleep pattern (siesta style), where you sleep once for 6 hours (core sleep), and then later for 20 minutes (power nap). This is the pattern that is the closest to the monophasic pattern I'm used to, and fits well into my schedule and lifestyle.

I've [tried the biphasic sleep pattern](http://biphasicsleepexperiment.blogspot.com/) once before in college, for 9 days. That experiment failed, for a number of reasons:

- First off, it was the other style of biphasic, which is 4.5 hours core sleep and 1.5 hours nap. This totals 6 hours, which is far less than what I'm used to (8 hours).
- Also, the 1.5 hour nap was too close to the 4.5 hour sleep at night, which made it hard to wake from, and I often overslept and thus couldn't settle into a rhythm.
- Speaking of which, I didn't have a regular time that I would sleep and wake, so my body couldn't get used to a fixed schedule.
- Finally, I didn't do it for long enough to get acclimated to it.

I will learn from those mistakes, and try something different this time. The main differences I'll focus on this time are:

- 20 minute nap earlier in the day, so as not to interfere with core sleep
- Sleep and wake on a strict schedule
- Attempt for at least 28 days to let it sink in before drawing conclusions

This is the exact schedule I will follow:

- **Core sleep**: 1:00 AM - 7:00 AM (6 hours)
- **Power nap**: 5:40 PM - 6:00 PM (20 mins)

If it works out, the main benefits I'm looking forward to are:

- A regular, predictable sleep schedule. I really struggle with the discipline to be regular in my sleep, which hurts productivity and often means I don't have a good slot in the day to exercise.
- Less time spent sleeping, more time to do other fun things.
- Sleep late at night, wake up early. This would be the best of both worlds; I don't have to give up on social activities late at night, but I still can wake up early and work out.

I'll keep a daily log below, measuring the following variables:

- Times asleep
- Mental alertness level
- Physical energy level

I want to make sure that I'm sleeping and waking regularly, and that my alertness and energy levels aren't suffering (after all, what's the use of more time in the day if I can't spend it effectively?).

I'll start this experiment tonight, and go for as long as I can. Sweet dreams!
