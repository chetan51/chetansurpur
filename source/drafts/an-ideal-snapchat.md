title: "An Ideal Snapchat"
---

Snapchat was recently acquired for 3 billion dollars. It's a ridiculous sum of money for a ridiculous product, and most people seem to think so, even the people who use it the most.

I personally hate Snapchat, with the burning fury of a thousand suns. It's not just me; even my friends who are probably in the top 20% of most active Snapchat users, have major qualms with it. But instead of complaining about all that is wrong with Snapchat, I'll instead describe a few (relatively) simple changes that I think can turn Snapchat from the worst app to take the market by storm in recent years to the ideal photo / video messaging service.


1. **Snap expiry options**

    We might as well start with the most foundational, and probably most controversial, proposal. I understand that Snapchat's greatest appeal is the ultimate privacy it offers. However, in an overwhelming majority of typical usage, you don't need the picture you send to expire in < 10 seconds. In fact, it's a depressing loss of valuable data that's wholly unnecessary. How many times have you wished to show something funny you received to someone else, or remembered it later and wanted to see it again?

    _When sending a snap, the default lifetime of the snap should be Unlimited. The sender can optionally choose to have the snap expire anywhere from 1-10 seconds._

    If the sender chooses Unlimited, the snap should be saved on both the sender and receiver's devices.

2. **Passcode lock**

    _By default, users should be asked to create a passcode to lock the app with. Optionally, this can be disabled._

    If you're going to be a privacy-centric app, why not add some security while you're at it?

3. **Import / export with built-in camera**

    _For Unlimited time snaps, the photo should automatically be saved to the sender's built-in camera. Any photo taken with the built-in camera should be available to import into Snapchat for sending. Receivers should be able to save Unlimited time snaps to their built-in cameras._

    This gives full freedom to the user to use whatever camera is more convenient, with the assurance that they can keep the snaps they want.

4.  **High-resolution images**

    Right now, I can visibly see the degradation of quality on my photo the moment I touch the Snapchat camera capture button. It makes me cringe.

    _Every photo and video taken with the Snapchat camera should be in full resolution, and received in full resolution._

    I know that makes scalability harder, but is that too much to ask for, from a $3b tech company?

5. **Groups. Seriously.**

    _After sending a snap to more than 1 person, the sender should be able to create a group of the receivers. Next time they send a snap, they should be able to select that group to send to. Ideally, these groups should be automatically created by watching the user's typical sending behavior._

    If you want people to send snaps to each other, don't make it a 20+ tap process, having to select each person individually. That's ridiculous.


So, that's it. Five simple changes that would take Snapchat from being worse than a nuisance to becoming a godsend. I'm all for sharing of transient moments with photos and videos, just do it right. Maybe then you'll be worth a fraction of the billions of dollars you're valued at.
