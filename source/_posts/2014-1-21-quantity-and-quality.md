In aspiring to become a better writer, I'll take a leaf from the book above. Consistency is the key to success, and instead of sitting here theorizing about perfection, I want to consistently improve my writing by actually writing.

With that spirit, I hereby declare:

**I will publish one blog post here every two weeks for the next year. For each two week stretch that I miss, I will post a separate statement of failure on this blog, immortalizing my shame for that period.**

It doesn't matter if the posts are good, bad, or ugly. I'm only being graded on quantity.

By the end of the year, if all goes well, I should be 25 _published_ posts better at writing than today.

Let the flurry begin!
