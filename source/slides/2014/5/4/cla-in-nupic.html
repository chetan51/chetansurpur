# Overview

.left-column[

  ## Sparse Distributed Representation (SDR)

]
.right-column[

  - The representation format of data in the CLA

  - Distributed: each bit has semantic meaning

  - Sparse: Few bits are on, most are off

  ![SDR](http://numenta.org/images/sdr.png)

]

---

.left-column[

  ## What is the Cortical Learning Algorithm?

]
.right-column[

  - The CLA is an algorithm that describes the operation of a single layer of cortical neurons

  - This layer can learn spatial and temporal patterns in data on its own

  - In a hierarchy (not a part of CLA), it would learn higher-level patterns

  - Each column represents some meaning

  - Each cell in that column represents that same meaning, but in a different context

  - Learning occurs by forming and un-forming connections between neurons

]

---

.left-column[

  ## CLA in NuPIC
  ### - Spatial Pooler

]
.right-column[

  - Converts a non-sparse representation of bits to an SDR

  - Groups together similar inputs (ones with overlapping bits

]

---

.left-column[

  ## CLA in NuPIC
  ### - Spatial Pooler
  ### - Temporal Pooler

]
.right-column[

  - (Should be called "Sequence Learner")

  - Learns transitions between SDRs

  - Predicts unions of SDRs

    - Trained on AB, AC, AD, given A predicts a compressed B+C+D

  - High-order memory: prediction of next SDR is based on SDRs seen many timesteps ago

    - Trained on ABCD, XBCY, given ABC predicts D, instead of D+Y

]

.footnote[.red[Note: Both SP and TP operate on the same layer of cortical neurons,<br> but it's useful to separate them functionally]]

---

.left-column[

  ## Inputs and outputs

]
.right-column[

  Let's start by treating the SP and TP as black boxes â€“ what do they take, and what do they produce?

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Inputs and outputs
  ### - Spatial Pooler

]
.right-column[

  ![IO of SP](http://placehold.it/600x350)

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Inputs and outputs
  ### - Spatial Pooler

]
.right-column[

  - Input is a vector of bits

    - Each bit should have semantic meaning, so that overlapping bits between inputs means something

    - Not necessarily sparse

    - Could be the output of an encoder (analogous to a retina) or the cells in a previous layer

  - Output is a (sparse) activation of columns

  - To the spatial pooler, each cell in a column behaves identically

  - The whole column is connected to inputs

  - "Why do we have cells then?" That will become clear when we get to the TP.

]

.left-column[

  ## Inputs and outputs
  ### - Spatial Pooler
  ### - Temporal Pooler

]
.right-column[

  ![IO of TP](http://placehold.it/600x350)

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Inputs and outputs
  ### - Spatial Pooler
  ### - Temporal Pooler

]
.right-column[

  - Input is the state of cells from last timestep, and a (sparse) activation of columns (the output of the SP) from the current timestep

  - Output is:

    - An activation of cells within columns, representing a selection of a particular context

    - A prediction (or depolarization) of cells

  - Looking at the set of columns that predicted cells are in gives you the next predicted SDR (and the cells in columns gives you context)

.left-column[

  ## Review input / output

]
.right-column[

  ![IO of SP](http://placehold.it/600x350)

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Function: Initialization
  ##### 1) Map potential

]
.right-column[

  - Each column is mapped to a subset of the input bits

  - Those input bits are the only ones the column can ever be connected to

  - When these input bits are on, the column is more likely to be activated

  - Relevant parameters: potentialRadius, potentialPct

  - potentialPct helps adjacent columns learn to represent different inputs

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Function: Initialization
  ##### 1) Map potential
  ##### 2) Initialize permanences

]
.right-column[

  - Permanence represents the potential for a connection to be formed between column and input

  - Relevant parameter: synPermConnected

    - The minimum permanence at which we consider the column to be "connected" to the input

  - Of the set of potential inputs for each column, initialize the permanence of connections between the column and each input

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Function: Initialization
  ##### 1) Map potential
  ##### 2) Initialize permanences

]
.right-column[

  - Several possible approaches

    - Gaussian (good for topology)

      - Each column has a natural center over the input bits 

      - Inputs close to the center have high permanence

      - Inputs far from the center have low permanence

    - Random (currently implemented, deviates from whitepaper)

      - Half (randomly selected) have permanence over connected threshold

      - Half have random permanence between 0 and connected threshold

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Function: Initialization
  ##### 1) Map potential
  ##### 2) Initialize permanences
  ##### 3) Update inhibition radius

]
.right-column[

  - Columns within the "inhibition radius" inhibit each other in order to produce sparse output

  - Inhibition radius grows as columns get "connected" to wider and wider range of inputs (and shrinks vice versa)

  - It's estimated as a function of:

    - The average range of inputs that each column is connected to

    - The average number of columns each input is connected to

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Function: Compute
  ##### 1) Calculate overlap

]
.right-column[

  - For each column, compute an "overlap score" that represents how many inputs that are active are "connected" to the column

  - "Boost" overlaps as necessary (will go into more detail later)

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Function: Compute
  ##### 1) Calculate overlap
  ##### 2) Inhibit columns

]
.right-column[

  - For each column, look at the neighboring columns within inhibition radius

  - Keep the top N columns with respect to overlap score

  - N is chosen to achieve a desired level of sparsity (relevant parameters: localAreaDensity, numActiveColumnsPerInhArea)

  - Results in a set of active columns, which is the output of the SP

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Function: Compute
  ##### 1) Calculate overlap
  ##### 2) Inhibit columns
  ##### 3) Perform learning: update connections

]
.right-column[

  - Connections to active inputs are strengthened, and connections to inactive inputs are weakened

  - Any column that becomes so weakly connected to its potential inputs that it can never become active in the future has all its connections strengthened (to keep it from dying)

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Function: Compute
  ##### 1) Calculate overlap
  ##### 2) Inhibit columns
  ##### 3) Perform learning: update connections
  ##### 4) Bump up weak columns and update boost factors

]
.right-column[

  - Strengthen connections of columns who don't have enough overlap with their inputs (relevant parameters: minOverlapDutyCycles, synPermBelowStimulusInc)

  - Get ready to boost in the next cycle those columns that aren't active enough (relevant parameter: minActiveDutyCycles)

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Function: Compute
  ##### 1) Calculate overlap
  ##### 2) Inhibit columns
  ##### 3) Perform learning: update connections
  ##### 4) Bump up weak columns and update boost factors
  ##### 5) Update inhibition radius

]
.right-column[

Same as during initialization.

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Learning disabled

]
.right-column[

  - Learning can be disabled

  - In this case, we stop after Compute step 2) Inhibit columns

]

# Temporal Pooler

.left-column[

  ## Review input / output

.right-column[

  ![IO of TP](http://placehold.it/600x350)

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Connections

]
.right-column[

  ![Connections of TP](http://placehold.it/600x350)

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Connections

]
.right-column[

  - Connections between cells are a little more complicated than the SP

  - A little bit of terminology

    - Each cell has multiple "distal dendrite segments"

    - Each distal dendrite segment connects to multiple cells in the layer

    - These connections indicate predictability of the cell due to the cells it's connected to

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Note on deviations from whitepaper

]
.right-column[

  - The are fairly major differences between the current TP implementation and the whitepaper

  - Put in to solve practical problems with small datasets while Grok was exploring different commercial opportunities

  - Many of the high level concepts are the same but there are many (non biological) differences

  - Currently in the process of re-implementing a pure whitepaper version of the TP

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Function: Compute
  ##### 1) Perform inference: activate cells

]
.right-column[

  - If new sequence, turn on "start cell" (the first one) for every active column

  - Otherwise, turn on any predicted cells in every active column

  - If no predicted cells in a column, turn on every cell in the column

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Function: Compute
  ##### 1) Perform inference: activate cells
  ##### 1.5) Backtrack

]
.right-column[

  - If number of predicted columns is over 50% of number of active columns

  - Rather than simply "giving up" and bursting on the unexpected input columns, a better approach is to see if perhaps we are in a sequence that started a few steps ago

  - Deviation from whitepaper, won't go into detail

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Function: Compute
  ##### 1) Perform inference: activate cells
  ##### 1.5) Backtrack
  ##### 2) Perform prediction

]
.right-column[

  - For each cell, if it has any active segments, predict the cell

  - A segment is active if it's connected to enough active cells

  - Results in a set of predicted cells, which is the output of the TP (along with the active cells from step 1)

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Function: Compute
  ##### 1) Perform inference: activate cells
  ##### 1.5) Backtrack
  ##### 2) Perform prediction
  ##### 2.5) Backtrack

]
.right-column[

  - If number of predicted columns is less than 50% of average number of active columns

  - Same process as before

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Function: Compute
  ##### 1) Perform inference: activate cells
  ##### 1.5) Backtrack
  ##### 2) Perform prediction
  ##### 2.5) Backtrack
  ##### 3) Perform learning: update connections

]
.right-column[

  ## Parallel state

  - This part of the implementation is a little tricky (and deviates from the whitepaper)

  - The state of active and predicted cells used for learning is stored independently of the state used for inference (what we saw earlier)

  - So we have to activate cells and then predict cells  (just like we did earlier) on this separate state

  - But the way we activate and predict cells will be different than for inference

  - Pretend we have two copy of the cells and connections, one for inference, and one for learning

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Function: Compute
  ##### 1) Perform inference: activate cells
  ##### 1.5) Backtrack
  ##### 2) Perform prediction
  ##### 2.5) Backtrack
  ##### 3) Perform learning: update connections

]
.right-column[

  ## Segment updates

  - They're queued-up updates to segments

  - Have a shelf-life (relevant parameter: segUpdateValidDuration)

  - Queued while cell is predictive

  - Applied when cell becomes active

  - Discarded when cell becomes inactive

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Function: Compute
  ##### 1) Perform inference: activate cells
  ##### 1.5) Backtrack
  ##### 2) Perform prediction
  ##### 2.5) Backtrack
  ##### 3) Perform learning: update connections

]
.right-column[

  ##### A) Apply any existing segment updates

  - Strengthen connections to active cells (relevant parameter: permanenceInc)

  - Weaken connections to inactive cells (relevant parameter: permanenceDec)

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Function: Compute
  ##### 1) Perform inference: activate cells
  ##### 1.5) Backtrack
  ##### 2) Perform prediction
  ##### 2.5) Backtrack
  ##### 3) Perform learning: update connections

]
.right-column[

  ##### B) Try to get better at predicting this sequence in the future

  - For each active column, activate any predicted cells

    - These are the same cells that just had their segment updates applied

  - There will be at most one predicted cell per column (different from inference state)

  - If there was no predicted cell, pick the best cell to learn on

    - The best cell overlaps with the most active inputs, regardless of permanence (relevant parameter: minThreshold)

  - If none are good, choose (using magic) a cell in the column to add a new segment to

    - This segment connects to a random subset of cells active in the last timestep (relevant parameter: newSynapseCount)

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Function: Compute
  ##### 1) Perform inference: activate cells
  ##### 1.5) Backtrack
  ##### 2) Perform prediction
  ##### 2.5) Backtrack
  ##### 3) Perform learning: update connections

]
.right-column[

  ##### C) Predict the next state, and queue up segment updates reinforcing what caused the prediction

  - For each column, pick the best cell and predict it

    - The best cell has the most active segment, due to other currently active cells

  - Queue up a segment update to reinforce that "most active" segment

]

---

.left-column[

  ## End of sequence

]
.right-column[

  - Can happen in 3 ways

    - Reset can be triggered manually

    - Too many unpredicted activations have occurred (relevant parameter: pamCounter)

    - We have reached the maximum allowed sequence length (relevant parameter: maxSeqLength)

  - If reset was called, at the start of the next sequence, won't do "Try to get better at predicting this sequence in the future" (TODO)

  - If reset was not called, we try to backtrack on the learn state

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Deviations from whitepaper
  ##### - Backtracking

]
.right-column[

  - Inference-backtracking

  - Learn-backtracking

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Deviations from whitepaper
  ##### - Backtracking
  ##### - "Pay Attention Mode"

]
.right-column[

  - After detecting an end of sequence, we stay in "Pay Attention Mode" for a number of timesteps (relevant parameter: pamLength)

  - When we are in PAM, we do not burst unpredicted columns during learning

  - The advantge of PAM mode is that it requires fewer presentations to learn a set of sequences which share elements

  - The disadvantage of PAM mode is that if a learned sequence is immediately followed by a set of elements that should be learned as a 2nd sequence, the first pamLength elements of that sequence will not be learned as part of that 2nd sequence

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Deviations from whitepaper
  ##### - Backtracking
  ##### - "Pay Attention Mode"
  ##### - Global, age-based decay

]
.right-column[

  - Ensures that we don't learn sequences that are too long

  - Any segments which haven't seen activity in a while have all their connections weakened slightly

  - Relevant parameters: globalDecay, maxAge

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Deviations from whitepaper
  ##### - Backtracking
  ##### - "Pay Attention Mode"
  ##### - Global, age-based decay
  ##### - Prevent oversampling from bursting columns

]
.right-column[

  - Learning has only one cell predicted per column

  - Might not be necessary with possible modification to chooseCellsToLearnFrom

    - Sample at most one cell per column

]

---

.left-column[

  ## Deviations from whitepaper
  ##### - Backtracking
  ##### - "Pay Attention Mode"
  ##### - Global, age-based decay
  ##### - Prevent oversampling from bursting columns
  ##### - Pooling / sequence segment

]
.right-column[

  - Outdated, need to remove

  - Since we're not really doing pooling, all segments are sequence segments

]

---

# R&D (our process)

- We have two parallel implementations of the SP and the TP

  - Python and C++

  - They are functionally identical

- Test out new ideas in the Python implementation

- Then port to C++ for performance

---

# Resources

- SP

  - Play with parameters: SP Viewer (https://github.com/iandanforth/spviewer)

  - See sample usage code: /examples/sp/hello_sp.py

  - Practice: CLA Quiz

- TP

  - See sample usage code: /examples/tp/hello_tp.py

  - More sophisticated examples of behavior: /examples/tp/tp_test.py

  - Practice: TP Quiz

  - Stay tuned for hackathon demos!

---

# Future Plans

- True temporal pooling

  - Currently, the "temporal pooler" is really just a sequence learner

  - We want to add (biologically realistic) functionality for pooling together known sequences into singular representations

  - Like representing a melody with the name of a song

  - Necessary for hierarchies

---

## Available Work

- Remove TP confidences calculation

  - https://github.com/numenta/nupic/issues/907

- Remove outdated pooling from TP

  - https://github.com/numenta/nupic/issues/908

- Support topology in the TP

  - Possibly supported with modification to chooseCellsToLearnFrom

    - Choose cells spatially close to the current one

  - https://github.com/numenta/nupic/issues/910

- Combine inference and learn states

  - Modify chooseCellsToLearnFrom to sample at most one cell per column

  - https://github.com/numenta/nupic/issues/909
