		<section>
			<p><em>A and B are leaving the IMAX movie theater where they have just finished watching</em> Interstellar <em>, looks of wonder and delight on their faces.</em></p>

<p>A: Wow, that was really something, wasn’t it?</p>

<p>B: Yeah, my mind is pretty bent out of shape right now. Who knew physics could be so goddamn <em>badass</em>.</p>

<p>A: Ah, yeah, the physics of space and time are some of the most exciting concepts in science. The movie did a great job of visualizing those ideas and making it a truly cinematic experience.</p>

<p>B: I read last week that everything in this movie was physically accurate. Is that true?</p>

<p>A: Yeah, pretty much. There were some flaws, but they depicted relativity pretty accurately.</p>

<p>B: Really? So it’s a physical fact that time slows down around black holes? And that you can age slower than your children?</p>

<p>A: Definitely. It’s as true as the fact that you can’t hear anything in the vacuum of space, or that matter can neither be created nor destroyed. It’s almost unbelievable, but it’s absolutely true.</p>

<p>B: That’s insane. But let’s say it is true, it’s still not something we’ll ever actually be able to see, right? It only happens in impossibly extreme situations, right?</p>

<p>A: Actually, we experience time dilation all the time. In fact, some of the technology we rely on daily depends on it.</p>

<p>B: Seriously? But how does that work? How in the world can you slow down time?</p>

<p>A: Well, you have to be careful when you talk about time. You can’t slow down time any more than you can create something out of nothing. That’s because there’s no such thing as absolute time for you to slow down. Rather, time slows down for you <em>relative</em> to me if you’re traveling closer to the speed of light than me.</p>

<p>B: Wait, wait. You’re gonna have to explain it to me from the beginning. Honestly, I’m not even sure what “time” is at this point.</p>

<p>A: Okay, let’s take it from the beginning then. But let me assure you; relativity is hard to believe, but it’s not too hard to understand.</p>

<h2 id="light">Light</h2>

<p><em>After getting two Icees, one red and one blue, A and B sit down at a table near the arcade of the theater. B sits back in his chair as A begins talking.</em></p>

<p>A: It all starts from one, simple, stunning fact. Repeat it after me: <strong>The speed of light is constant.</strong></p>

<p>B: “The speed of light is constant.” Okay, but what does that mean?</p>

<p>A: It means that no matter your vantage point, no matter where you are or how fast you’re moving, light will look to you to be traveling at exactly…</p>

<p><em>A quickly looks something up on his phone.</em></p>

<p>…299,792,458 meters per second. We call that speed <code>c</code>.</p>

<p>B: That’s pretty damn fast. But why is that fact stunning again?</p>

<p>A: Okay, think about this. Let’s say we’re standing in a field, playing catch with a baseball. I throw the ball to you at 40 miles per hour. When you catch it, you register it as moving at 40 miles per hour. So far so good?</p>

<p>Now, let’s say you’re sprinting towards me at 15 miles per hour. I throw the ball at 40, and you catch it. The moment you catch it, how fast would you register the ball to be moving at?</p>

<p>B: Well, if the ball is moving towards me at 40, and I’m moving towards the ball at 15, then I’ll feel the ball hit my hand at 55 miles per hour. Right?</p>

<p>A: Correct. The speed of the ball, relative to you, is 55 miles per hour. The speed of the ball, relative to me, is 40 miles per hour (the speed I threw it at). The difference comes from the fact that you’re moving towards the ball, and I’m not.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you were running away from me at 15 miles per hour, the ball would seem to you to be moving slower, at 25 miles per hour instead (the ball’s 40 minus your 15). Nothing surprising so far.</p>

<p><em>A takes a sip from his red Icee, slowly, to avoid getting brainfreeze.</em></p>

<p>A: Now let’s swap out the baseball for light.</p>

<p>If I shine light towards you, it would leave me at <code>c</code>, the speed of light. So if you’re running towards me at 15 miles per hour, how fast would you expect the light to hit you?</p>

<p>B: Well, like the baseball, it should be moving at <code>c</code> plus 15 miles per hour, whatever that is.</p>

<p>A: It should, right? The stunning fact is that you wouldn’t see the light as moving at <code>c</code> plus 15 miles per hour. You would see the light as moving at exactly <code>c</code>.</p>

<p>B: Wait, what? So you’re saying that my motion has no effect on how fast the light seems to be moving? Well what if I was moving at half the speed of light? What then?</p>

<p>A: So you’re suggesting that I shine the light at you at <code>c</code>, and you’re moving towards me at half <code>c</code>. Even in that unlikely case, you would still see the light hit you at exactly <code>c</code>, no more, no less.</p>

<p>B: So light doesn’t behave like a baseball? Figures.</p>

<p>A: Not in the least.</p>

<h2 id="simultaneity">Simultaneity</h2>

<p>B: So what does that have to do with time dilation?</p>

<p>A: We’re getting there. I just told you that the speed of light is constant, regardless of relative motion. Let’s take that idea to its logical conclusion.</p>

<p>B: Okay. I did get the feeling that if light doesn’t follow the laws of motion that baseballs do, it could put things out of whack. I mean, something has to break, right?</p>

<p>A: Yeah, things do get pretty weird. It’s those effects that we’ll explore now. You’ll see how strange things become when you accept the fact of the constant speed of light.</p>

<p>Imagine two people, Mr. Front and Ms. Back, are sitting across from a table in a stationary train. In between them, on the table, is a lamp that is off. They are witnesses in a curious game.</p>

<p>The game is being played between Dr. In, who is sitting in the train with them, and Dr. Out, who is standing on the platform outside of the train. Both doctors are equidistant from the two witnesses.</p>

<p>The rules of the game are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>At some point, the lamp will be turned on.</li>
  <li>The moment either of them see light from the lamp, that person will throw up their hands.</li>
  <li>If both of them throw up their hands at the same time, Dr. In will win $1 million from Dr. Out.</li>
  <li>If both of them throw up their hands at different times, Dr. In will pay $1 million to Dr. Out.</li>
</ul>

<p>B: I’ve heard of this kind of thing. It’s called a thought experiment, right?</p>

<p>A: Yes. Einstein famously used these kinds of thought experiments to think up relativity in the first place. It’s actually quite fun when you get into it.</p>

<p>B: Okay, go ahead then.</p>

<p>A: So the first round of this game, the train is stationary at the platform. With Dr. In watching from inside the train, and Dr. Out watching through the windows from outside the train, the lamp is turned on.</p>

<p>Both of them see the light hit the eyes of each witness, and see Mr. Front and Mr. Back raise their hands at the same time. This isn’t surprising, and perhaps Dr. Out didn’t think it through when he made the bet. He reluctantly hands over a million dollars to Dr. In, who gleefully accepts the money.</p>

<p>B: Cool. I’m guessing the train starts moving in the next round.</p>

<p>A: Yes, you’re ahead of me. Now, in the next round, the train is moving towards the side that Mr. Front is sitting. It is approaching the platform where Dr. Out is standing and waiting.</p>

<p>At the moment that Dr. Out is equidistant from the two witnesses, the lamp turns on.</p>

<p>You might find this hard to believe, so let’s walk through what happens step by step.</p>

<p>When the lamp turns on, light radiates out from it in all directions. Two beams of light start traveling in opposite directions, one towards Mr. Front and one towards Ms. Back.</p>

<p>Inside the train, Dr. In sees the two beams of light traveling at the same speed, <code>c</code>, towards each witness. It doesn’t matter that the three of them are sitting in a moving train. For all intents and purposes, they could be sitting in a stationary train, and the rest of the world could be moving instead. The key is that the two witnesses and the doctor are all stationary relative to each other. So Dr. In sees the light reach both of their eyes simultaneously, and they both raise their hands together. Dr. In shouts with glee, having just won another million dollars.</p>

<p>From outside the train, Dr. Out also sees the two beams of light traveling at the same speed, <code>c</code>, towards each witness. However, relative to Dr. Out, Mr. Front is moving away from his light beam, and Ms. Back is moving towards her light beam. This means that one beam has to travel more distance to reach Mr. Front than the other has to travel to reach Ms. Back. We said that the speed of light is constant, right? That means that Mr. Front’s beam has to take longer to reach him than Ms. Back’s beam takes to reach her. After all, Mr. Front’s beam is traveling at the same speed over a longer distance. What does this imply? Dr. Out sees Ms. Back raise her hands <em>before</em> Mr. Front does! Dr. Out wins the game!</p>

<p>B: Hold on. Didn’t you say earlier that Dr. In won the game? How could they both win? There must be a mistake somewhere.</p>

<p>A: Believe it or not, there’s no mistake. From the perspective of Dr. In, both witnesses raised their hands at the exact same time. From the perspective of Dr. Out, Ms. back raised her hands before Mr. Front. Neither of them is mistaken about their own account of events. Both of them are correct from their own perspective.</p>

<p>B: Okay, but what about from a third perspective? From an absolute perspective? Who truly won?</p>

<p>A: That’s the craziest thing about all this. There’s no absolute perspective. Every perspective into the situation is relative, and every perspective is right. This is called the relativity of simultaneity, and it means that when one observer considers two events to be simultaneous, another observer (in relative motion) might disagree, and say the events were not simultaneous. And they would both be correct.</p>

<p>B: How does that even make sense? This is hurting my head.</p>

<p>A: Here’s an analogy to make it more palatable.</p>

<p>Let’s say you’re standing up close to a tree, and you stretch your hands to measure how tall it is. I stand far away, and stretch my hands to measure it as well. Your hands will be stretched far wider than my hands, right? So we disagree on how tall the tree is (how much space it occupies) relative to us, since we are different relative distances away from it. Who’s right about the size of the tree? Well, we both are, considering our own perspectives.</p>

<p>It’s the same kind of thing, except instead of different relative distances, it’s different relative speeds, and instead of disagreeing on space, it’s disagreement on time.</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>B: Hmm, that helps a bit. But now I’m confused about what “time” is.</p>

<p>A: Time is a tricky beast to pin down. It’s hard to define time without using the word “time” in the definition. For now, let’s just say that time is a measure of the intervals between events. So if two events occur simultaneously, we say they happened at the same time.</p>

<p>With this definition of “time”, notice that the thought experiment we just went through deals with simultaneity, and so it is also speaking about time. Since the relative intervals between events is different for the two observers, we say that time itself is different between them.</p>

<p>Of course, the speed of light is so ridiculously fast compared to the speed of the train, that you would hardly notice the effect. But rest assured that the effect is there, and that if you actually conducted this experiment, and had precise enough measurements, you would notice a difference in simultaneity between the doctor on the train and the doctor on the platform. In fact, experiments like this have actually been conducted over the years, and we have actually measured exactly this effect with great precision.</p>

<p>B: Okay, I believe you. But what’s so special about light that it can actually affect the perception of time? I’m guessing that sound doesn’t have this property, that the speed of sound isn’t constant, right? What makes light different from sound?</p>

<p>A: Good question. Sound is different from light in that sound depends on the medium that it travels in. The speed of sound in water is different from the speed of sound in air. That’s because sound is literally the motion of molecules of the medium hitting each other to produce a wave of movement. It’s a derivative property of matter, and so it is a slave to the rules of matter. Light, on the other hand, is independent of medium, and it stands on its own. In some ways, it defines our universe, since after all it is the lens through which we observe the universe. So when light has some property, the universe has that property.</p>

<p>In other words, light and time and two sides of the same coin. Up until we discovered relativity, we thought light behaves like baseballs and every day matter do, that its speed changes with motion. So we made assumptions about time, that it is an absolute measurement, that it is fixed and universal. This is the common and intuitive belief about how time works. But when we realized that the speed of light is constant, we realized the implications for time: time is relative and local.</p>

<p>For example, let’s say we conducted our previous thought experiment on the train with baseballs instead. We would find that both doctors would agree that the witnesses caught the balls and raised their hands at the same time. Nothing would have changed for Dr. In, sitting in the train, again because there is no relative motion between the people on the train.</p>

<p>But for Dr. Out standing on the platform, the ball moving towards Mr. Front, thought it has to travel a longer distance than the ball moving towards Ms. Back, it would be given a “kick” by the forward motion of the train, and so it would be moving faster. The ball moving towards Ms. Back would be pulled forward by the train as well, and so it would be moving slower. Thus, both balls will reach their destinations at the same time.</p>

<p>However, since we used light, we found that light doesn’t get a “kick” from the train, because it can’t move faster or slower than <code>c</code>. So the way the universe compensates is that <em>time itself</em> is different for Dr. Out than for Dr. In.</p>

<p>B: Alright. I’m not sure I really know what time is now, it feels vague and muddled to me.</p>

<p>A: That’s understandable. It’s a tricky concept. But don’t worry, because when I explain to you the next crazy result of relativity, I’ll give you a clearer definition of time that should help. Just hang in there.</p>

<p>B: There’s more? More craziness than this?</p>

<p>A (<em>winking</em>): This was only the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<h2 id="dilation">Dilation</h2>

<p><em>It is getting late. A and B decide to begin the long drive home, and talk in the car. B is navigating, using the GPS on his phone.</em></p>

<p>GPS (<em>in electronic voice</em>): In 1.5 miles, use the left lane to turn left on Calavaras street.</p>

<p>A: Let me tell you something you probably would never have guessed about that device you’re holding there.</p>

<p>B: What, my phone?</p>

<p>A: The GPS in your phone. It’s communicating with satellites orbiting Earth to determine your position, right?</p>

<p>B: Yeah.</p>

<p>A: In order to know how far away you are, the satellite measures how long it took a beam of light to travel to it from your GPS device. If it knows what time the light left your device, and what time the light arrived, it can use the speed of light to know how much distance the light traveled. Using these measurements of distance, a few satellites can work together to determine your location on Earth.</p>

<p>B: Interesting.</p>

<p>A: That’s not even the really interesting part. Now, remember that the satellite trying to measure the distance to you is orbiting Earth, so it’s moving very quickly relative to you. From the thought experiment with the train, what did we say happens with relative motion?</p>

<p>B: Let’s see… the satellite and my GPS have different perspectives of time?</p>

<p>A: Yes. So here’s the most interesting bit: because the satellite is in motion relative to you, a clock on the satellite would seem to you to be ticking more slowly than a clock here in your hand.</p>

<p>B: You mean clocks slow down in space?</p>

<p>A: No, what I’m saying is that a clock in motion relative to you would seem to be running slower than a stationary clock in your hand. The motion of the satellite makes the passage of time on the satellite slower than the passage of time that you would observe standing here.</p>

<p>In fact, the satellite must account for this difference in the rate of time when it’s measuring the distance to you using light beams. If it assumes that its clock and your clock are running at the same rate, like you might have before this conversation, it would measure the distance to you incorrectly and GPS simply wouldn’t work.</p>

<p>B: Wow. Does that mean that if I sit on a satellite orbiting Earth, I would see clocks on Earth ticking faster than a clock on the satellite?</p>

<p>A: Actually, no. If you stood on Earth and looked at a satellite, the satellite’s clocks would seem to be ticking slower. That’s because the satellite is moving relative to you. But if you stood on a satellite, and looked at Earth, we can say that now Earth is moving relative to you. It goes both ways. So you would see clocks on Earth ticker slower, not faster.</p>

<p>B: But it’s the satellite that’s moving, not Earth!</p>

<p>A: How do you say that? What’s to stop the satellite from saying that it is stationary, and Earth is moving instead? Motion is relative, there are no absolutes. You can’t just say the satellite is moving, that means nothing. You have to say the satellite is moving, <em>with respect to you</em>.</p>

<p>I have to caveat this discussion: when we talk about motion, we’re talking about constant velocity motion. No one is accelerating, no forces are being applied. If instead, you were on a satellite and you were <em>accelerating</em>, moving faster and faster over time, then you couldn’t say that you are stationary and rather that Earth is moving. Because you know that you are exerting a force, and so you are definitely not stationary. Only when talking about constant velocity motion can you claim that Earth is moving relative to you, and so clocks on Earth tick more slowly than yours. When acceleration gets involved, things get even weirder, but we won’t go there yet.</p>

<p>B: Huh, okay. So when everyone is moving with constant velocity, everyone perceives everyone else’s clocks to be ticking more slowly than theirs?</p>

<p>A: Correct. And keep in mind that it’s not just that clocks are ticking slower. Rather, the clocks are ticking slower because time itself seems to be running more slowly. Everything is slower, not just clocks.</p>

<p>B (<em>exasperatedly</em>): But why?</p>

<p>A: Isn’t that the golden question. Okay, here’s how we’ll do this. In the interest of time (no pun intended), I’ll first give you an answer that’s related to the speed of light, but I doubt you’ll find it very intuitive. Then I’ll give you the better definition of time that I promised you earlier, and that should give you a more intuitive understanding of time dilation in the case of relative motion.</p>

<p>The reason time is slower for someone in motion relative to you is that for them, light has to travel a longer distance than it has to for you. After all, they are moving, and light has to move with them. But the speed of light is constant, so the only way it can travel the longer distance for them is if time itself is slower for them. In this way, relative motion affects relative distance light has to travel, which affects the relative rate of time.</p>

<p>B: You were right. I don’t find that intuitive at all.</p>

<p>A: Then let me give you the explanation I prefer.</p>

<p>Everything works out really well if you define time as simply the fourth dimension, in addition to the three dimensions of space. We move through time in the same way as we can move through space.</p>

<p>Forget about that for a moment, and think about this:</p>

<p>Let’s say you’re driving a car, and you can either move forward, or to the right, or some combination of both, at a particular fixed speed <code>s</code>. If you move straight forward, then you will not be moving to the right at all. If you move diagonally, half of your motion will be forwards, and half of your motion will be towards the right. The key thing to notice is that if you move diagonally instead of straight forward, your motion in the forwards direction will be reduced, you’ll be moving more slowly in that direction (since you’re moving at a fixed speed either way). The more you move towards the right, the less you move forwards.</p>

<p>What does this have to do with time? Can you guess?</p>

<p>B: Uhh. I really have no idea. It makes sense so far, but I don’t see the connection.</p>

<p>A: I’ll explain. But before that, there’s one more fact I forgot to mention earlier, which is very interesting in its own right, and very relevant here. You may have heard this before.</p>

<p>An unbreakable law of the universe is that nothing with mass can move through space faster than the speed of light. It’s like a universal speed limit. And we’ll shortly see why that fits beautifully with everything else.</p>

<p>B: Yeah, I’ve heard of that before.</p>

<p>A: Good. So I said we can define time as the fourth dimension. And I said matter cannot move through faster than the speed of light. This is how it all fits together:</p>

<p>Let’s say you’re sitting stationary, and I’m running away from you at half of the speed of light. Yeah, I can run really goddamn fast.</p>

<p>What’s happening is that both of us are moving through four-dimensional spacetime at the speed of light. In fact, all matter constantly moves through spacetime at the speed of light.</p>

<p>Since you’re stationary and so not moving through space, you’re moving through time at exactly the speed of light. Since I’m moving through space at half the speed of light, my motion in time is reduced. It’s just like the car that moves diagonally instead of straight forward; its motion forward is reduced. So because I’m moving through space at half the speed of light, and my overall speed of motion is the speed of light, my motion in the dimension of time is half the speed of light, or half of the speed of your motion through time.</p>

<p>That’s why when I’m moving relative to you in space, time runs slower for me.</p>

<p>B: Whoa. That’s so trippy.</p>

<p>A: It’s also why matter cannot move through space faster than the speed of light, because that would require it to be moving through time with negative speed. And that’s just not physically possible.</p>

<p>Now, the most important thing to remember is that I told this story through your perspective, sitting in a chair, but it can just as well be told through my perspective, running at constant velocity (half the speed of light) away from you. From my perspective, I can easily say that I’m stationary and you’re moving away from me at half the speed of light, since neither of us are accelerating. So to me, you’re moving through time at half the speed that I am. It goes both ways.</p>

<p>B: Got it. It’s difficult to think of time as another dimension on top of space, but it does seem to make sense.</p>

<p>A: Yeah, it’s very useful to think of us as moving through the fabric of spacetime, with our motion distributed between the four dimensions (three of space and one of time). Especially when gravity and acceleration come into the picture. Because the cleanest way to describe gravity is as a force that warps the fabric of spacetime. This simple definition completely clarifies the enigmatic effect gravity has on matter and motion.</p>

<p>B: So gravity is tied into this whole thing too? What does it mean to warp the fabric of spacetime?</p>

<p>A: It’s utterly fascinating. When we add gravity and acceleration, we find ourselves in the realm of actual time travel. The twins paradox, for example, is a thought experiment that will blow your mind.</p>

<p>But let’s save that for another day. I think it’s time for bed.</p>
