		<h1 class="title content">The Stress of Time</h1>
		
		<section class="p-content">
			<p>There is a powerful and persistent stress that plagues me. It arises spontaneously in my day, and I have little control over when it flares up. It’s always nagging at the back of my mind, like a vague ache that you learn to ignore but one that never really goes away. It is the stress of the finiteness of our lives, and Willy Wonka characterized it best: <em>So much to do, and so little time.</em></p>

<p>The world is a beautiful place, and our lives have so much potential for enjoyment and happiness. There are an infinite number of experiences for us to partake in, to immerse ourselves in, to learn and grow from. Ironically, this wonderful thought lends itself to the stress that stems from the simple, undeniable fact that there are only 24 hours in the day.</p>

<p>You might have felt it too. There are so many things to do, so many things to get done, and not enough time for it all. You have to choose, prioritize, sacrifice. And when you focus on one thing at any given moment, you are giving up an infinity of other things you could be doing instead, things you will never get to.</p>

<p>The issue is not that I feel underachieved, or dissatisfied with my work. I’m actually confident that I work hard, and am generally productive and happy in what I do. The issue is simply that no matter how much I do, it will never come close to all that I want to do. The gap is insurmountable, and I’m setting myself up for disappointment.</p>

<p>Stress is not intrinsically a bad thing. Valid stress can be a powerful tool if applied correctly, a powerful motivator in cases of true desperation. If you need to meet a deadline, externally or internally imposed, and you act on the stress to push yourself to success, the reward to your brain is enormous. You feel validated, and you’re more encouraged to push yourself to success again. The problem is not with stress, but with unchecked stress. When you don’t act on stress and reduce it actively, it can eat you alive.</p>

<p>With that in mind, one can ask the right questions. Is the stress valid? If so, how do you intend on taking action on it? If it’s not valid, how do you intend on changing your approach to eliminating it?</p>

<p>In this case, the stress is not valid. It doesn’t help to constantly fear the regret of not meeting my unrealistic dreams of doing it all. It just detracts from the pleasure of what I am actually able to get done. So I need to work on eliminating it.</p>

<p>But how?</p>

<p>First and foremost, a change of attitude towards work is in order. Instead of asking myself, “What should I work on right now?”, I’ll ask myself, “What do I want to work on right now?” The difference is subtle but vast. When I think about <em>should</em>, I do so because I’m prioritizing and planning. Whenever I pick something I <em>should</em> work on, I’m leaving out all the other stuff I should also be working on. Instead, if I think about what I <em>want</em> to work on, I can’t go wrong. Everything will bring enjoyment, so I should just pick what I’m most leaning towards.</p>

<p>This requires certain trust in myself that what I want to work on at any given moment will be what is best for me. In addition to my interests at the time, it will also be motivated by the pressures of goals and deadlines, so even if I do keep putting off something I don’t want to work on right now, the pressure will build up, and I’ll start to itch for it. It’s a self-organizing principle, and I need to trust it.</p>

<p>The more challenging aspect of reducing this stress is learning to let go. Be aware of the past and the future, but live in the present. I have to keep reminding myself that there will always be more time to do things I want to do, and all that matters is what I’m doing right now. The future is uncertain, so just forget about it. The stress will appear unbidden from time to time, like a stray thought appears in consciousness during meditation, but as long as I am aware of it when it comes, I can learn to let it go. Let go with the confidence that it is not necessary to worry, because the future holds only more time to do what I want to do, so I can safely keep my eyes on the present.</p>

<p>As long as I am working hard, being productive, and happy with what I’m doing, there is no reason to feel regret. The inescapable truth is that the universe is infinite and our lives are finite. All that we do will only brush an infinitesimally small bit at the surface of everything that can be done. So what’s the point in worrying about it all? All we can do is enjoy what we can do, and enjoy it to the fullest.</p>
