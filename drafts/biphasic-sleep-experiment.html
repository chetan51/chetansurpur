		<h1 class="title content">Biphasic Sleep Experiment</h1>
		
		<section class="p-content">
			<p>Most of us sleep once daily, for 8-9 hours every night. For someone who has too much to do and not enough time, these are a great many precious hours wasted. But there is a potential solution. Instead of sleeping once daily, <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Polyphasic_sleep">polyphasic sleep patterns</a> promise equal to more effective sleep in less time. These claims aren’t necessarily substantiated, but I want to try for myself.</p>

<p>There are a few options for different sleep cycles. I’ve settled on the biphasic sleep pattern (siesta style), where you sleep once for 6 hours (core sleep), and then later for 20 minutes (power nap). This is the pattern that is the closest to the monophasic pattern I’m used to, and fits well into my schedule and lifestyle.</p>

<p>I’ve <a href="http://biphasicsleepexperiment.blogspot.com/">tried the biphasic sleep pattern</a> once before in college, for 9 days. That experiment failed, for a number of reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First off, it was the other style of biphasic, which is 4.5 hours core sleep and 1.5 hours nap. This totals 6 hours, which is far less than what I’m used to (8 hours).</li>
  <li>Also, the 1.5 hour nap was too close to the 4.5 hour sleep at night, which made it hard to wake from, and I often overslept and thus couldn’t settle into a rhythm.</li>
  <li>Speaking of which, I didn’t have a regular time that I would sleep and wake, so my body couldn’t get used to a fixed schedule.</li>
  <li>Finally, I didn’t do it for long enough to get acclimated to it.</li>
</ul>

<p>I will learn from those mistakes, and try something different this time. The main differences I’ll focus on this time are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>20 minute nap earlier in the day, so as not to interfere with core sleep</li>
  <li>Sleep and wake on a strict schedule</li>
  <li>Attempt for at least 28 days to let it sink in before drawing conclusions</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the exact schedule I will follow:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Core sleep</strong>: 1:00 AM - 7:00 AM (6 hours)</li>
  <li><strong>Power nap</strong>: 5:40 PM - 6:00 PM (20 mins)</li>
</ul>

<p>If it works out, the main benefits I’m looking forward to are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A regular, predictable sleep schedule. I really struggle with the discipline to be regular in my sleep, which hurts productivity and often means I don’t have a good slot in the day to exercise.</li>
  <li>Less time spent sleeping, more time to do other fun things.</li>
  <li>Sleep late at night, wake up early. This would be the best of both worlds; I don’t have to give up on social activities late at night, but I still can wake up early and work out.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll keep a daily log below, measuring the following variables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Times asleep, snoozed, quality</li>
  <li>Physical activity</li>
  <li>Mental alertness level</li>
  <li>Physical energy level</li>
  <li>Eye moisture levels</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to make sure that I’m sleeping and waking regularly, and that my alertness and energy levels aren’t suffering (after all, what’s the use of more time in the day if I can’t spend it effectively?). I also have dry eyes that seem to get worse with sleep deprivation, so I’ll measure that too.</p>

<p>I’ll start this experiment tonight, and go for as long as I can. Sweet dreams!</p>

<h2 id="daily-log">Daily Log</h2>

<h3 id="day-0-sep-18-2015---friday">Day 0 (Sep. 18, 2015 - Friday)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Alertness: <strong>High</strong></li>
  <li>Energy: <strong>Medium</strong></li>
  <li>Eye moisture: <strong>High</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I had a little over 7 hours of sleep last night, which isn’t ideal because I’m a tiny bit tired. Also, I just drank Soylent for dinner. This is only the second time I’ve tried it. So I hope it doesn’t interfere with my sleep tonight. But I’ll just start the experiment tonight and we’ll see what happens.</p>

<h3 id="day-1-sep-19-2015---saturday">Day 1 (Sep. 19, 2015 - Saturday)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Sleep (core): <strong>1 AM - 7 AM (6 hours) (+0 snooze)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Quality: <strong>Medium</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sleep (nap): <strong>5:50 PM - 6:10 PM (20 mins) (+0 snooze)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Quality: <strong>High</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Physical activity: <strong>None</strong></li>
  <li>Alertness: <strong>High</strong></li>
  <li>Energy: <strong>Medium</strong></li>
  <li>Eye moisture: <strong>Medium</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I woke up several times at night, but fell back asleep immediately. It was hard to wake up in the morning but I did it without snoozing. I just stayed in bed for 1.25 hours on my phone because I couldn’t bring myself out of bed. I decided not to work out this morning, partly because of laziness and partly because I didn’t want to tax my body too much at once. It definitely feels great to be up early and have the rest of the day available. I’m not feeling 100% energized though; I hope I wake up more over the course of the day.</p>

<p>The nap felt great. It went by quickly, and I felt fully energized about 30 minutes after waking up from it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I lost track of time and am sleeping 30 minutes late tonight. Can’t let that keep happening.</p>

<h3 id="day-2-sep-20-2015---sunday">Day 2 (Sep. 20, 2015 - Sunday)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Sleep (core): <strong>1:30 AM - 7:30 AM (6 hours) (+15 min snooze)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Quality: <strong>Medium</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sleep (nap): <strong>5:55 PM - 6:15 PM (20 mins) (+0 snooze)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Quality: <strong>High</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Physical activity: <strong>None</strong></li>
  <li>Alertness: <strong>Medium-Low</strong></li>
  <li>Energy: <strong>Medium</strong></li>
  <li>Eye moisture: <strong>Medium</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>It was exceedingly difficult to wake up this morning. I could barely keep my eyes open. I stayed in bed for 1.5 hours on my phone, partly because it was hard to get out of bed, and partly because it’s Sunday. Even after 2 hours, I’m still feeling sleepy. I also didn’t get great sleep last night, because I kept waking up for some reason. Maybe it was too hot in my room.</p>

<p>After I had lunch, I was more refreshed. The nap was great, and waking up from it was easy. I’ve still been feeling sleepy all day, I can feel the sleep deprivation feeling hitting me. Let’s see if my body adjusts though.</p>

<p>I’m sleeping late tonight because of hanging out with friends. Even sleeping as late as 1 isn’t easy to be disciplined about when you live with friends. I have to try harder though if I want this to work.</p>

<h3 id="day-3-sep-21-2015---monday">Day 3 (Sep. 21, 2015 - Monday)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Sleep (core): <strong>2:10 AM - 8:10 AM (6 hours) (+0 snooze)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Quality: <strong>High</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sleep (nap): <strong>6:10 PM - 6:30 PM (20 mins) (+0 snooze)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Quality: <strong>High</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Physical activity: <strong>Low</strong></li>
  <li>Alertness: <strong>Medium-High</strong></li>
  <li>Energy: <strong>Medium</strong></li>
  <li>Eye moisture: <strong>Medium-High</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I woke up only once tonight, and it was because I was feeling too hot. I opened the window and then I didn’t wake up again. In the morning when I woke up, I felt sleepy, but within half an hour I was very awake and alert. It’s been a couple hours and I’m still feeling great. I wonder if my body is getting used to the schedule now. I still haven’t tried working out to see how that will affect my sleep; I’ll do it after I’m fully used to this. I went on a long walk in the morning, which felt good but I felt a little tired afterwards.</p>

<p>I started feeling more tired closer to nap time. I napped a little later than usual today. Felt refreshed after I woke up from it. But as the day progressed, I felt tired again, and by bedtime at night I was very sleepy. I’m also starting to sneeze and my nose is starting to run a bit, so I might be falling sick. That would throw a wrench in these biphasic plans, so I hope I don’t completely fall sick. If I feel sick tomorrow morning, I might just sleep in.</p>

<h3 id="day-4-sep-22-2015---tuesday">Day 4 (Sep. 22, 2015 - Tuesday)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Sleep (core): <strong>1:10 AM - 8:35 AM (6 hours) (+1.42 hours snooze)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Quality: <strong>High</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I wasn’t feeling sick, but I slept in anyway. I was just way too sleepy to wake up at 7 AM. It’s almost noon and I’m still quite sleepy. I thought about it a lot, and I’ve decided to change the target schedule to get more sleep (but still be biphasic).</p>

<h2 id="experiment-update">Experiment Update</h2>

<p>I probably haven’t let the current experiment run for long enough to get used to it, but I can’t run on 6 hours 20 minutes of sleep anymore. Therefore, <strong>I’m switching to 6 hours core and 1.5 hours nap.</strong></p>

<p>It’s not as groundbreaking, but should be more sustainable and still allow me to sleep late at night and wake early. Time-wise, it’s still 30 minutes less than 8 hours monophasic, and I’ll try to build a habit of getting out of bed immediately, which should save some more time. If I miss my 1.5 hour nap in a day, I’ll be monophasic that night. That way I can be biphasic when possible, and switch back and forth as convenient.</p>

<p>I’ll start this today by taking a 1.5 hour nap when I get back home from work. I’ll also be able to exercise starting tomorrow since I won’t be as sleep-deprived.</p>
